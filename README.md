# Mission_to_Mars

## Overview of Analysis
Robin is now ready to take on the full web-scraping and data analysis project for the mission to Mars. She’s learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. She’s also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

You’ll help Robin scrape, organize, analyze, and visualize the data. As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

> How many months exist on Mars?

  12 months exist on Mars!
  
  
> How many Martian days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
 
  The scraped dataset contains 1867 Martian days worth of data!
  
  
> What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars?

  The months with the coldest temperatures are months three and four with an average minimum temperature of -83 degrees. The month with the warmest average temperature is month eight with an average minimum temperature of -68 degrees.
  
  
> Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?

  Month six has the lowest atmospheric pressure on Mars with an average pressure of 745.
  Month nine has the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars with an average pressure of 913.
  
  
> About how many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? That is, in the time that Mars circles the Sun once, how many days elapse on Earth?

  Judging from the lowest peaks on the Daily Minimum Temperature on Mars plot, approximately 700 days exist in a Martian year shown by the lowest peaks in temperatures seen just after 550 days and 1250 days.
